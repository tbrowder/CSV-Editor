=head1 NAME

B<CSV::Editor> - Provides a simple viewer and editor for CSV files

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=begin code :lang<raku>

use CSV::Editor;
$ csv-edit $christmas-list # edit the text CSV table of addresses
=end code

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<CSV::Editor> is a simple, visual editor for text CSV files.

It has a few format restrictions:

=item the only valid field separators are
=item2 comma: C<,>
=item2 semicolon: C<;>
=item2 pipe (vertical line): C<|>
=item the following objects are not allowed in a B<valid> field
unless they are escaped with a backslash (C<\>)
=item2 octothorpe or pound sign: C<#>

Its current capabilities are:

=item allow the user to edit the viewed file
=item align the valid fields so each field has the same widths
=item left-justify the contents of valid fields
=item allow saving the current view (state) of the file
=item allow comment lines beginning with a pound sign ('#')
=item ignoring the rest of the file when encountering a line beginning with '=finish'

Note the record lines with comments and lines on and after '=finish'
are conidered invalid CSV records but B<are saved with the file>.

=head2 Motivation and source

This project was motivated by my old, but updated, Christmas
list management program started in 1993 as a Perl 4 
project and gradually converted to Perl 5 and then to
Raku (Perl 6) in 2016. Record fields were pipe separated and
lines commented out when contacts were no longer valid or
wanted.

There was no easy way to align the fields with conventional CSV
reader/writer programs. This past week I wrote the included
I<Requirements> dovument and fed it to ChatGPT which gave
me a gigantic start. Since then I've been fixing errors and
changing things which didn't quite work. 

One of the major problems was the use of Map which I find is
the source of a lot of hidden mistakes (which I find
hard to 'grok'). I wind up unpacking the Maps so I can (1)
understand the intent and (2) fix problem more easily.
